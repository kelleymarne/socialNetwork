## Description

> Challenge #18- NoSQL Social Media Back-End

## Introduction 
We were instructed to create the back end of a social media website using NoSQL. We needed to set up an API with routes referring to the 'User' and then the ability to create a 'Thought' as well as leave a 'Reaction'. 

The User routes include:
- GET all Users
- GET User by ID
- CREATE User
- UPDATE User by ID
- DELETE User by ID

The Thought and Reaction routes include:
- GET all Thoughts 
- GET Thought by ID
- CREATE a new Thought
- UPDATE Thought by ID
- UPDATE a Thought by PUTTING a Reaction
- DELETE a Thought by ID
- DELETE a Reaction by UPDATING a Thought

## Challenges

Overall the set-up of this project was very straight forward and easy to get structured. However the one hiccup that i did run into was with the routes for the Thoughts. I had a hard time getting my reactions routes to recognize the thoughtId. I realized i just had referenced it wrong in the routing and got the worked out pretty quickly.

## Victories

NoSQL is a breath of fresh air after the last leg of the coursework. I have really enjoyed working with this technology. I'm starting to feel less confused by the larger file structures that come with the full-stack. This project was especially easy to set up after the modules this week. It was really similar as far as the skeleton you need to set up for this technology, espcially with no front end to tie up with it. I really enjoyed this project!
